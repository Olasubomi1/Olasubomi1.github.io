					<h3><ins> Best life qoute</ins></h3></br>
					Teaching is a calling too.</br>
					And I've always thought that</br> 
					teachers in their ways are holy-angels</br>
					leading their flocks out of the darkness.

				<h3>Tribute</h3>
				<p>
					Lovable and sometimes intimidating figures, <br>
					our teachers can present us with important life opportunities,<br>
					 inspire us to discover our vocation, <br>
					and motivate and guide us along the way.<br>
					  <br>
					Some days we love them, other days we hate them<br>
					for expecting too much from us. <br>
					<br>
					A teacher’s true appreciation comes with age. <br>
					Too few of us understand a teacher’s value and<br>
					 effort while we are still students. <br>
					We want to spend our time having fun,<br>
					 not doing tons of homework. <br>
					We don’t realize yet that being good<br>
					 at something takes practice, <br>
					but our teachers do.<br>
					<br>
					It is when we mature that we truly admire these people <br>
					and begin to recognize the positive difference they made in our lives.<br>
					 There comes a point where we start being thankful to all our teachers, <br>
					 good or bad, but the most memorable ones will always be the ones who <br>
					 believed in us when we didn’t believe in ourselves.<br>
